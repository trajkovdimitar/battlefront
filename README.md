## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Strategy Gameplay**: Expand your territory and engage in strategic battles
- **Alliance System**: Form alliances with other players for mutual defense
- **Multiple Maps**: Play across various geographical regions including Europe, Asia, Africa, and more
- **Resource Management**: Balance your expansion with defensive capabilities
- **Cross-platform**: Play in any modern web browser

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.2 or higher)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd battlefront
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run inst
   ```

   Do NOT use `npm install` nor `npm i` but instead use our `npm run inst`. It runs the safer `npm ci --ignore-scripts` to install dependencies exactly according to the versions in `package-lock.json` and doesn't run scripts. This can prevent being hit by a supply chain attack.

## 🎮 Running the Game

### Development Mode

Run both the client and server in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the webpack dev server for the client
- Launch the game server with development settings
- Open the game in your default browser (to disable this behavior, set `SKIP_BROWSER_OPEN=true` in your environment)

### Client Only

To run just the client with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run start:client
```

### Server Only

To run just the server with development settings:

```bash
npm run start:server-dev
```

### Connecting to staging or production backends

Sometimes it's useful to connect to production servers when replaying a game, testing user profiles, purchases, or login flow.

> To replay a production game, make sure you're on the same commit that the game you want to replay was executed on, you can find the `gitCommit` value via `https://api.openfront.io/game/[gameId]`.
> Unfinished games cannot be replayed on localhost.

To connect to staging api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:staging
```

To connect to production api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:prod
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools
